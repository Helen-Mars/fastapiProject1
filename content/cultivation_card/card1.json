    "description": "The rain begins with a prelude of pattering drops, thunder dancing in the distance. Soon, a wistful flute pierces the air, echoing with melancholy. The guqin follows—its tones steady and timeless, anchoring all things, letting them settle and return to stillness.<br>\"Pay no heed to wind and rain upon the trees—why not chant and stroll with ease?\"<br>Bamboo staff and straw sandals outmatch a fine horse—so why fear? Let the misty rain cloak me; I live freely, come what may.<br>Looking back on that bleak and desolate place—returning, there is no storm, no sunshine, only peace. To return, to come home—shaped and shapeless, both at once.",
